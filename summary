pipeline:
1. fastqc: 
look at raw reads; quality of sequencing 
fastqc report: (1) normally it's fine; sequencing quality is high; while some bad quality tiles
2. trimmomatic: 
trim out bad quality reads
3. STAR: 
aligning reads; output gene counttable and bw files
using UCSC genome browser to visulize RNA reads( or significant genes) https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg19&lastVirtModeType=default&lastVirtModeExtraState=&virtModeType=default&virtMode=0&nonVirtPosition=&position=chr17%3A32580371-32586145&hgsid=588697437_sMHfvJVWlONy51OQMFtCDcwoGW0M 
mouse or human reads? (see the xlsx file) => don't think pronunced mouse transcripts detected
4. qualimap: 
metrics of the mapping reads (exonic reads mapping rate, or reads distribution over gene body)
5. EdgeR: 
differential analysis
several groups cluster closely to each other
24weekdb is more similar to PBS treatment and fewer significant genes;
age is an important factor: 14weekdb and 14weekwt seems similar to each (no significant genes);
however, 14weekdb vs 14weekwt show a lot of significant genes

Another thing:
the version of edgeR seems to affect the result a little.
version in mac: 3.16.5  more generous significance calling
version in desktop: 3.8.6 more stringent
